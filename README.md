# A React Bookshelf

This is a bookshelf project built in React for the [Udacity React Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019).

## Instructions

Follow these steps to run this project from your local server: 

1. Clone this repository - `git clone https://github.com/tyhopp/react-bookshelf`
2. Change into the project repo - `cd react-bookshelf`
3. Download the node modules - `npm install`
4. Start the project - `npm start` or `yarn start`

## Functionality

This bookshelf allows you to organize your books by "Currently Reading", "Want To Read", and "Read". Move books from shelf to shelf by selecting the book's dropdown and selecting the desired shelf. 

You can also search available books by clicking on the plus icon. From there, use the same method to move the book to the desired shelf on your bookshelf.

## A Note on Search Terms

The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend.

## Attributions

Base HTML and CSS styles were provided by the React Nanodegree team from the [starter template](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter). It was also bootstrapped with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md), where you can find more common tasks to perform.
