Notes

To fix 403 error: 
Note - .filter filters out the book from your "library" if it's in there, .concat is used to join arrays - in this case we're simply adding the book back on


OLD CODE: 

  changeShelf = (book) => {
    this.setState((state) => ({
      books: state.books.filter((b) => b.shelf !== book.shelf)
    }))
    BooksAPI.update(book, book.shelf)
  }

NEW CODE: 

	changeShelf = (book, shelf) => {
	    BooksAPI.update(book, shelf).then(response => {
	      book.shelf = shelf
	      this.setState((state) => ({
	        books: state.books.filter((b) => b.id !== book.id).concat([ book ])
	      }))      
	    })
	  }


Next Steps:
1. Create a <Book> component, which you use like this <Book book={book} />
2. Next, implement each shelf by using something like {this.state.books.filter(book => book.shelf === currentlyReading').map((book) => ( in BookList.js
